			<h3>2. Please describe the difficulties you have faced in your career as a Software Developer </h3>
		</div>
		
		<div id="answer">
			<p>Sundeep has stepped into many shoes during his journey as a Software Developer. Below are some of the challenges & obstacles he articulated based on experience.<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				  <li><u>Analysis paralysis</u>-Over-analysing a problem or a solution takes up many man-hours and can prove detrimental in the the long haul.</li>
				  <li><u>Sprint planning</u>-While transitioning from the traditional software development model to Agile, Sundeep talks about the dire consequences of not planning a sprint correctly. As one of the technical leads, he has to spend considerable amount of time on choosing the right User Stories to groom and implement.</li>
				  <li><u>Story sizes to fit into one Sprint</u>-He further explains how important it is to make sure the user-stories chosen are not over-promised to the Product Manager and dont overwhelm the developers. </li>
				  <li><u>Overengineering a solution vs. just right solution</u></li>
				  <li><u>Cross functional dependencies</u>– One of the major roles of a Technical Leader are making the right trade-offs. Functional requirements clarification should be given equal priority as Product marketing feedback. </li>
				  <li><u>Proposing and overcoming communication challenges</u>-The communication stream between the senior management, Product manager, developers and other technical leads needs to be efficient and effective. This proves as a major challenge due to availability co-ordination and time-constraints. </li>
				  <li><u>Skill set Issues</u>-Lack of open source tools knowledge that can be ideally reused
				</ul>
